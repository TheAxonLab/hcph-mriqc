            "The majority of pilot sessions are corrupted by eye-spillover that overlaps cortical matter.",
            "In the pilot sessions, aliasing ghosts are always visible in background but not visible on the cortical matter which is good.",
            "Several pilot sessions present weird stripes at the inter-hemispheral commissure in occipital lobe.",
            "It seems pilot sessions have lower contrast than normal sessions.",
            "All normal sessions present an eye-spillover but perpendicular to the brain so it nicely does not overlap with cortical matter.",
            "Some normal sessions present head-motion related ringing, especially in lower frontal lobe."
